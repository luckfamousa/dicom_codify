DICOM Standard 2014 -- De-Identifier Codeified
==============================================

The goal of this project is to grab data elements from
Table E.1-1, Application Level Confidentiality
Profile Attributes for any DICOM utility to adhere to
an Application Level Confidentiality Profile
within the DICOM Standard, 2014 edition.

Effectively, this repo will assist in properly
anonymizing a DICOM file by removing all sensitive
patient information within a DICOM file.

The focus of this repo is the De-identify section
within PS 3.15, 2014:
